Given an integer array, your task is to find all the different possible increasing subsequences whose length are large than 1 of the given array.

Example:

Input: [4, 6, 7, 7]
Output: [[4, 6], [4, 7], [4, 6, 7], [4, 6, 7, 7], [6, 7], [6, 7, 7], [7,7], [4,7,7]]

Note:

    The length of the given array will not exceed 15.
    The range of integer in the given array is [-100, 100].
    The given array may contain duplicates, and two equal integers should also be considered as a special case of increasing sequence.
