some things are better left unsaid
some feelings come a little too late
i will tell you who to get the flag
you flew away when i opened my hand
and i will never be able to catch you again

Apologies/ Farewell :-

Some things are better left unsaid,
some feelings come a little too late.
You flew away when I opened my hand,
and I'll never be able to catch you again.

In this black & white world, you gave me color,
but I couldn't love you when I loved another.
how can you smile and still look so sad,
when you lost something you never had.

Some words are better left unspoken,
some loves are meant to be forsaken,
if fate would have our paths cross someday,
we'll smile to a stranger and go on our way.

In this life, we're not meant for each other,
it could happen in the next if you believe in another,
what has come to be I will never regret
the memories we've made I shall forget.
